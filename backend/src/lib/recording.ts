 * Every recorded track is its own egress job — a separate handler process on the Hetzner
 * box, holding its own connection to the SFU — and measurement on that box put a video
 * track at roughly 0.06-0.11 of a core, a microphone at about half that. Crucially the
 * cost tracks the *number* of tracks and not their bitrate (track egress copies the codec
 * rather than re-encoding, so a 6 Mbps screen share and a 720p camera cost about the same),
 * which makes capping the count the only lever that scales with headcount.
 *
 * 20 is what the compositor can actually draw (`MAX_FACES_IN_GRID` in
 * recording-compositor/src/layout.ts) and what the live grid shows before it starts
 * scrolling (`MAX_LIVE_TILES`), so the cap can never cost the finished video a face it had
 * room for. Anyone past it is still in the recording: presence is tracked independently of
 * tracks (see `openParticipantPresence`), and the compositor gives a participant with no
 * camera their avatar tile — the same path someone who simply had their camera off takes.
 *
 * Microphones and screen shares are deliberately not capped. A dropped mic loses somebody's
 * voice for the whole call, and the screen share is usually the reason the call is being
 * recorded at all.
